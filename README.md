## TL;DR    

A windsurf-demo production that highlights how the Playwright MCP plugin and workflows can automate testing. By iteratively prompting and troubleshooting, you achieve reliable and visually verifiable testing outcomes.

# Playwright MCP Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use the Playwright MCP plugin effectively, specifically tailored for showcasing the windsurf-demo.
There are two important workflows:

- pw-mcp-setup, sets up the file
- pw-browser-tester, runs the browser tests
- nuke-pw, takes it down from scratch, use this for errors

## Overview

This project provides a guided way of running the Playwright MCP demo, which includes three key phases:

1. **Setup**: Prepare your environment and install necessary dependencies.
2. **Execution**: Run the defined Playwright MCP workflow.
3. **Analysis**: Evaluate and troubleshoot the results produced by the workflow with a visual demonstration.

## Demo Workflow

Follow these steps to successfully execute and demonstrate the workflow:

### 1. Setup the Project

* Install the **Playwright MCP Plugin** directly from the official Playwright website (avoid using the plugin from Windsurf Store as it's out of date).

Add the following to your Windsurf MCP config (Click Hammer Icon above cascade chat > Configure):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

* Optional: Run `nuke-pw` to clean up any previous Playwright MCP server instances and ensure the port is available.


### 2. Execute the Workflow - Use the prompt below

* Initiates the workflow by running `pw-mcp-setup`. This automatically installs required npm packages and builds the playwright config to be conformant with demo best practices.

* Prompt the workflow to handle the Dark Mode use case explicitly, this works and is repeatable. I would recommend experimenting with other use cases if you wish :) (If you can think of any cool semi-reliable ones let me know!) 

A recommended prompt is (prompt + workflow at once):

  ```
  /pw-browser-tester

  Create tests for dark mode. Write four tests for dark mode:
  - Open the settings panel
  - Toggle dark mode ON
  - Toggle dark mode OFF
  - Close the settings panel
  ```

### 3. Analyze and Visualize the Results

* Due to non-deterministic behaviors of LLM-based agents, some tests may initially fail.
* Analyze the failures with follow-up prompts to diagnose and resolve code issues.
* Once issues are fixed, visually confirm success by prompting:

```
Run the tests and use MCP to show browser actions.
```
* Sit back and watch 🍿
  * When it initially runs it the tests usually fail, it also attempts to self-rectify

## Known Issues

* **Using the Playwright MCP plugin from Windsurf Plugin Store is out of date.**
* The MCP fails to find the port when it's not on 5000 exactly, attempts to edit the file. Run nuke-pw before you start. 
* In the rare instance it does something strange with windsurf browsers and your chrome profile (I cannot reproduce this), exit windsurf entirely and re-open it. 
* Much higher chance of glitching out with Claude 3.7, use Claude 4
    * I have not tested with other models
* **If the tool calls for the Playwright MCP fail, refresh the MCP and continue - this one happens frequently**
